# Simple-windows-2fa
This is a very simple windows 2fa application.\
![image](resources/DemoShot.png)\
It saves a encrypted version of your 2fa key in enc2.txt.
it automatically copies your 2fa code to your clipboard.

The creation of this came because i could not find a desktop 2fa application that had the features what i wanted.

This application makes use of https://github.com/CosminPerRam/2fa-CPP for generating the OTP.
